This repository contains the source material for our laboratory **User Testing Guides** repository in our **Breast Diagnosis Systems** (e.g. [prototype-breast-cancer](https://github.com/MIMBCD-UI/prototype-breast-screening)). The general template can be found on the [`src/`](src/) directory, while the *samples* can be found at [`samples/`](samples/) directory. We used the [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) format, a typesetting system that includes features designed for the production of technical and scientific documentation. [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) is available as [free software](https://www.latex-project.org/lppl/).
