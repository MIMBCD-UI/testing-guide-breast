\section{Reporting Results}

A \hyperlink{https://github.com/MIMBCD-UI/research-reports}{Test Report} will be provided at the end of this tests. It will consist of a report and/or a presentation of the results; evaluation of the metrics against the pre-approved goals, subjective evaluations, and specific issues of the system, as well as, recommendations for resolution. The recommendations will be categorically sized by development to aid in implementation strategy. The results will be translated to a \hyperlink{https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YaOugDtaTZ1kTFgx2RKt-EkeHDzg5BH_plYmC7E1MT0/edit?usp=sharing}{spreadsheet} (view only).
