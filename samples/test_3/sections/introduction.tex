\section{Introduction}

This document aims to describe the protocol performing a set of tests in the scope of \hyperlink{https://github.com/MIMBCD-UI/prototype-breast-screening/releases/tag/v1.0.6-alpha}{v1.0.6-alpha} version from the \hyperlink{https://github.com/MIMBCD-UI/prototype-breast-cancer}{prototype-breast-cancer} repository of the \hyperlink{https://mimbcd-ui.github.io/}{Medical Imaging Multimodality of Breast Cancer Diagnosis User Interface (MIMBCD-UI)} project using a traditional devices (mouse and keyboard). The goal of the test is to understand the user, performance, efficiency and efficacy metrics. With the session, the sessions will be recorded via video on the computer and using a record, heat-map and triggered event tools. It is guaranteed the confidentiality of the recordings, which will be used only for academic purposes.

Dividing each test session into three parts. In one test the traditional device is supported by the interaction with mouse and keyboard. The second part, we will do a small questionnaire about the experience and feel. Finally, the third part we will have a final survey about preferences of users.
