\section{Apparatus}
\label{sec:sec005}

Questionnaires and data collection will be performed through the \href{http://forms.google.com/}{Google Forms} platform.
The group of questionnaires will be sent via e-mail and social networking platforms for an expected n $>$ 300 number of participants.
For this study, we used e-mail to spread our questionnaires, but also used \href{https://www.facebook.com/}{Facebook} groups, \href{https://www.reddit.com/}{Reddit} and \href{https://www.linkedin.com/}{LinkedIn}.
To support us on the \href{https://www.linkedin.com/}{LinkedIn} social network, we will use \href{https://www.linkedhelper.com/}{LinkedHelper2}, a powerful \href{https://www.linkedin.com/}{LinkedIn} automation software.
The \href{https://www.linkedhelper.com/}{LinkedHelper2} tool is providing us an automatically invite targeted level of contacts with a personal note.
With that functionality, we can spread easily our questionnaires thanks to the auto-responder messaging system of this tool.
