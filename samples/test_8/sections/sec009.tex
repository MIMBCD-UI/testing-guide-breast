\section{Goals}
\label{sec:sec009}

The research goals of this work are: (i) to investigate the effects of AI on technology adoption; (ii) to increase our understanding of differences in the determinants of technology use; and (iii) to improve the explanatory power and predictive accuracy of parsimony questionary based on known UTAUT constructs for broader application in HCI research.
For testing the hypothesis the questionnaire will comprise several questions (items) for responses on a Likert-type scale, ranging from 1-``Strongly disagree'', 2-``Disagree'', 3-``Undecided'', 4-``Agree'' and 5-``Strongly agree''. To ensure the content validity of the questionnaire used to assess each construct, all items regarding the measurement of constructs were adapted from previous studies and carefully reworded to fit the context of AI systems which can ge generalized for diagnostic systems.
